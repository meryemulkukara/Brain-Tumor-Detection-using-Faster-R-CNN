# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-Faster-R-CNN

Classification and localization is a popular task that is used for classifying the object and finding the objectâ€™s location
in the image. For multi-object detection, Faster R-CNN is one of the efficient and fast model. In this assignment, you
will use the best pretrained model from your previous assignment for the backbone.
